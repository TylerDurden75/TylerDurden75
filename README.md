# Hi I'm Thibault <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I'm Thibault J from France, if Dr. COX were DEV he would call me "newbie", perhaps <img src="https://gfycat.com/sizzlingdarlingconey">. Would i overReact[{...}] ? No ! because "my biggest mistake would be not to make mistakes" ‚úç(‚óî‚ó°‚óî).

Also, you might have noticed that I really appreciate REACT. As oppposed to JD who had a mentor, I learned React on my own. Juggling between Redux, Redux-Saga, Hooks and different Patterns and approaches.

What I love is making code extensible, scalable and reusable.
